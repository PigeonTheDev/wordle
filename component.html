        Welcome to the popular word guessing game Wordle! Here is how to play; There aren't any clues up front, so any five-letter word will do as an initial guess. That's where
        the game of Wordle really starts. When you send a guess along, the color of each letter's box changes. If it turns green, that letter is in the daily word and you've placed
        it in the right spot. If it turns yellow, the letter is in the word but you have it in the wrong position. If the box turns grey, it means the letter isn't in the word at
        all. The website serves up a simple explainer graphic for first-time visitors that lays it all out clearly.
